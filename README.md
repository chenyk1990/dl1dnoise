**dl1dnoise**
======

## Description

**dl1dnoise** package is used to store the reproducible and open-access scripts for Single-channel microseismic denoising using dictionary learning, which can be straightforwardly applied to improve arrival picking and source location.

## NOTES:
 
1. To run the reproducible scripts (test_xxxx.m), please first download the required package from: https://github.com/chenyk1990/MATseisdl. 

2. Please put the MATseisdl package in the main directory and add its sub-directories to the Matlab toolbox path. 

3. The scripts beginning with "test_" are runnable scripts.

5. The directory [subroutines](https://github.com/chenyk1990/dl1dnoise/tree/main/subroutines) stores all the required subroutines. 

9. The current version is based on Matlab. Future versions will also support Python and be optimized regarding computational efficiency. 


12. All figures (except for fig1, which is a schematic plot) in the dl1dnoise paper are in the following directory for a quick look (https://github.com/chenyk1990/dl1dnoise/tree/main/gallery/). 

13. The label fonts are different across different Matlab versions and platforms (Linux, Max). The figures presented in the paper are from Mac-Pro Matlab 2022b. 

14. If the package is too large for downloading, the following option can be used:

	svn co https://github.com/chenyk1990/dl1dnoise/trunk dl1dnoise
	
	svn co https://github.com/chenyk1990/dl1dnoise/trunk/raw dl1dnoise/raw
	
	Then, run the scripts in dl1dnoise.

## Gallery
The gallery figures of the dl1dnoise package can be found at
    https://github.com/chenyk1990/gallery/tree/main/dl1dnoise
Each figure in the gallery directory corresponds to a test_figNO.m script in the "main" directory with the exactly the same file name (figNO.png).

These gallery figures are also presented below.
